<p>Welcome to my home on the Web! You found your way here, you might as well stay a while. </p>

<p>I grew up in Western India, then headed north for college, studying Computer Science &amp; Engineering from IIT Roorkee. After college, I spent a year studying &amp; learning anything that I got my hands on &amp; became interested in entrepreneurship. So I spent next year splitting my time between learning new stuff and starting a company with my long-time friends. We successfully built a core of enthusiastic and loyal customers, but our need for additional funding, combined with the risky environment, led to our decision to shut down.</p>

<p>I enjoy music of all types, though do I have a special fondness for “classical” music. I also enjoy various contemporary pop/rock artists. In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting, and studying Krav Maga.</p>
