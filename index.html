<p>Welcome to my home on the Web! You found your way here, you might as well stay a while. </p>

<p>I'm focused on solving problems at the intersection of technology, strategy and behavioral science, with a background in startups, technology and design.</p>

<p>As a developer, my main tools are Ruby on Rails, Python, and PostgreSQL, in addition to my extensive experience in MySQL and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. My past experience includes technology strategy and architecting fault-tolerant systems that handled hundreds of thousands of unique users.</p>

<p>As a designer, I'm focused on building smart, elegant and intuitive interfaces with a focus on accomplishing specific user behaviors and developing an enjoyable experience, incorporating concepts in psychology.</p>

<p>As a strategist, I study complex systems and strategies on navigating competitive and adversarial environments. On the business side, I'm focused on creating businesses with coherent customer acquisition, customer retention, and business development strategies. I also concern myself with strategies on scaling startup teams and maintaining optimal communication within teams.</p>

<p>I enjoy music of all types, though do I have a special fondness for “classical” music. I also enjoy various contemporary pop/rock artists. In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting, and studying Krav Maga.</p>
