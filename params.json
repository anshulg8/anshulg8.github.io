{"name":"Anshul Garg","tagline":"Entrepreneur | Computer Science | IIT Roorkee","body":"### Hello from Anshul Garg!\r\nWelcome to my home on the Web! You found your way here, you might as well stay a while. \r\n\r\nI grew up in Western India, then headed north for college, studying Computer Science & Engineering from IIT Roorkee. After college, I spent a year studying & learning anything that I got my hands on & became interested in entrepreneurship. So I spent next year splitting my time between learning new stuff and starting a company with my long-time friends. We successfully built a core of enthusiastic and loyal customers, but our need for additional funding, combined with the risky environment, led to our decision to shut down.\r\n\r\n### Entertainment\r\nI enjoy music of all types, though do I have a special fondness for “classical” music. I also enjoy various contemporary pop/rock artists. In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting, and studying Krav Maga.\r\n\r\n### I am Social\r\nYou can find me speaking in 140 characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anshulg8), sharing some code on [Github](https://github.com/anshulg8), sharing some moments on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/anshulg8), answering questions on [Quora](https://quora.com/Anshul-Garg-8) and connecting with like-minded people on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshulgarg8).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
